    "Python 3.8 was released on October 14, 2019 and included several new features and improvements over its predecessor, Python 3.7. Some of the notable new features added in Python 3.8 are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assignment Expressions (the Walrus Operator): This new operator (:=) allows you to assign a value to a variable as part of an expression. This can be especially useful in loops and comprehensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Positional-only parameters: Python 3.8 introduced support for defining positional-only parameters in function definitions. These parameters can only be passed by position and cannot be specified by name.\n",
    "\n",
    "f-strings now support = for self-documenting expressions and debugging: With Python 3.8, you can now use the equal sign (=) within f-strings to help self-document the code or to aid in debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simpler and more flexible customization of class creation: Python 3.8 introduced several new features to make it easier to customize class creation, including the ability to intercept class creation and modify class dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time module now uses clock_gettime() on Unix platforms: The time module now uses clock_gettime() instead of gettimeofday() on Unix platforms, providing higher resolution and better accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "New syntax warnings: Python 3.8 introduced new syntax warnings to help identify potentially problematic code, including a DeprecationWarning for the use of the open() function with mode='U' and a SyntaxWarning for the use of a colon (:) in an f-string expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improvements to the multiprocessing module: Python 3.8 includes several improvements to the multiprocessing module, including the ability to specify the maximum number of tasks in a ProcessPoolExecutor, better support for using shared memory, and improved error handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just some of the new features and improvements that were added in Python 3.8.\n",
