It takes one argument - the name of the attribute being accessed - and should return the value of the attribute. If you don't define __getattribute__, the default implementation is called instead, which simply looks up the attribute in the object's __dict__ attribute. However, if you define __getattribute__, it will always be called instead of the default implementation."
