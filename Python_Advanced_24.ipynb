This way, the module can import the class or function without importing the entire module.\n",

Any other symbols in the module that are not listed in \"all\" are not exported and are not accessible from the importing module.\n",

First, it provides a way for module authors to control what symbols are exported from their module and prevent unintentional exports.

Finally, it can help to prevent naming conflicts and improve code safety by restricting access to certain symbols in a module.\n",
