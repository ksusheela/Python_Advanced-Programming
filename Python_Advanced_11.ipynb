    " Python, a metaclass is a class that defines the behavior of other classes. In other words, it is a class that creates classes. Metaclasses are often used to customize the behavior of classes and to add new features to the class creation process.\n",

    "When you define a class in Python, the default metaclass is type. The type metaclass is responsible for creating the class and setting up its attributes, methods, and other properties.\n",
    "\n",

However, using the metaclass argument is generally considered to be more explicit and easier to understand, especially for developers who are not familiar with the specific inheritance hierarchy of the class. Additionally, using the metaclass argument allows you to define the metaclass separately from the class definition, making it easier to reuse the same metaclass in multiple classes."
