    "Multiple inheritance is a feature of object-oriented programming languages that allows a class to inherit properties and methods from multiple parent classes. In multiple inheritance, a derived class is created by inheriting from two or more base classes, and it acquires all the properties and methods of the base classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if there are two base classes A and B, and a derived class C that inherits from both A and B, then C would have access to all the public and protected members of A and B. This allows for greater code reusability and flexibility in designing complex systems. However, multiple inheritance can also lead to problems like the diamond problem, where there is ambiguity in resolving conflicting method names or attributes from different parent classes."

    "Delegation is a design pattern in which an object forwards a request to another object to perform a task or provide a service, rather than handling the request itself. In other words, delegation allows one object to use the functionality of another object by passing on tasks to it, rather than implementing the tasks itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Delegation can be used to achieve separation of concerns, where an object responsible for one aspect of a system can delegate tasks related to other aspects to other objects that are specialized for those tasks. This can make code more modular and easier to maintain, since objects are responsible for a well-defined set of tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a GUI component might delegate user input handling to a controller object, which in turn delegates database operations to a data access object. By using delegation, each object can focus on its specific responsibility, making the overall system more flexible and easier to extend or modify"

It can also help to avoid the potential problems that can arise from the use of multiple inheritance, such as the diamond problem.\n",

    "For example, consider a car object that is composed of various components such as an engine, wheels, and a steering mechanism. Each component can be implemented as a separate object with its own set of methods and properties. The car object can then be composed by creating references to each of these components and using them to provide the functionality of the car as a whole. By using composition, the car object can be easily extended or modified by adding or removing components as needed, without affecting the behavior of the other components.\n",
