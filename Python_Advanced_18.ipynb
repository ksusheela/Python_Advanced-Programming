    "Text files and binary files are two different types of computer files. A text file contains ASCII or Unicode characters that can be read and edited using a text editor, while a binary file contains non-textual data that is encoded in binary format, such as images, audio, video, or executable code. Text files are human-readable and are often used for storing program source code, configuration files, and data in plain text format. Binary files, on the other hand, are not human-readable and are used for storing data that cannot be easily represented in text format. Binary files are often used for storing multimedia content, data for computer games, and other types of data that require efficient storage and retrieval. In summary, the main difference between text and binary files is the way they store data: text files store data in ASCII or Unicode characters, while binary files store data in a non-textual, binary format."

For example, a binary file written on a little-endian system may not be readable on a big-endian system, or vice versa. To avoid this issue, it's important to specify the byte order explicitly when reading or writing binary data, using the appropriate format string in the struct module.\n",

In contrast, text files are typically easier to work with, since they can be read and written using standard file I/O functions, and the data is in a human-readable format that is easy to understand and manipulate."
