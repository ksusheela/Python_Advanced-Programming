    "A probability distribution is a function or a mathematical formula that describes the probability of different possible outcomes of a random event. The distribution provides a way to predict the likelihood of various outcomes of the event, based on the probability assigned to each possible value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, a probability distribution assigns probabilities to each possible value or range of values that a random variable can take. The distribution describes the behavior of the random variable, including its mean, variance, and other statistical properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is true that the individual outcomes of a random event are unpredictable and occur by chance. However, the distribution of the outcomes can still be predicted based on their underlying probability distribution. This is because the distribution represents the relative frequencies with which the different outcomes are expected to occur, based on the probability assigned to each possible value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider rolling a fair six-sided die. Each outcome of rolling the die (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) is equally likely to occur, with a probability of 1/6. Therefore, the probability distribution of rolling the die is uniform, with each possible outcome having an equal probability of occurring.\n",

These processes are completely random and independent of each other, and therefore the numbers generated from them are truly unpredictable and unbiased.\n",

    "Pseudo-random numbers, on the other hand, are generated using mathematical algorithms that simulate randomness. Although they appear to be random, they are actually deterministic and repeatable, meaning that the same sequence of numbers will be generated every time the algorithm is run with the same starting value or seed. Pseudo-random numbers are not truly random but are good enough for many purposes, such as simulations, cryptography, and scientific experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why pseudo-random numbers are considered \"good enough\" is that they have many of the statistical properties of truly random numbers. For example, they can pass statistical tests for randomness, and they exhibit properties such as independence, uniformity, and unpredictability. In many cases, the performance of pseudo-random number generators is more than sufficient for practical applications, and the use of true random numbers is not necessary. However, in some applications, such as cryptography or gambling, true random numbers may be necessary to ensure the security and fairness of the system.\n",

It determines the location of the peak of the distribution and the point around which the data is symmetrical. A change in the mean value will shift the entire distribution left or right.\n",
    "\n",

A larger standard deviation will result in a wider distribution with more spread out data, while a smaller standard deviation will result in a narrower distribution with less variation in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, the mean and standard deviation completely describe the normal distribution. The normal distribution is a bell-shaped curve with the mean at the center, and the standard deviation determines the height and width of the curve. The majority of the data falls within one, two, or three standard deviations from the mean, making the normal distribution a widely used model in statistics and probability theory."
