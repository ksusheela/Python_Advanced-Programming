    "float is a built-in Python class that represents a floating-point number with a finite precision. It is implemented using the IEEE 754 standard and is optimized for speed and memory usage. The float class is good for general-purpose floating-point arithmetic, but it has some drawbacks. One of the main drawbacks is that it is not suitable for financial calculations that require exact decimal precision. Another drawback is that it suffers from rounding errors due to the way floating-point numbers are represented in binary form.\n",
