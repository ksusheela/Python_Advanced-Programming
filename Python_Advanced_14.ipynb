    "Memory efficiency: Generators are memory efficient because they generate values on-the-fly, one at a time, instead of generating all the values at once and storing them in memory. This makes them particularly useful for working with large datasets or infinite sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lazy evaluation: Generators are evaluated lazily, which means that they only generate values as they are requested by the program. This can help improve performance by avoiding unnecessary computation and memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterability: Generators are iterable, which means that they can be used in any context where an iterable is expected, such as in a for loop or with the built-in sum() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplified code: Generators can often simplify code by removing the need for explicit loops and temporary data structures. For example, a generator expression can replace a list comprehension when only one value is needed at a time.\n",
