    "In object-oriented programming, an abstract superclass is a class that is declared with the \"abstract\" keyword and contains one or more abstract methods. An abstract method is a method that is declared but not defined in the abstract superclass, meaning it has no implementation. Instead, the responsibility of implementing the abstract method is left to the concrete subclasses that inherit from the abstract superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "The abstract superclass provides a common interface or contract for all of its subclasses, which are required to implement the abstract methods. This ensures that all subclasses have certain common behaviors or characteristics, while still allowing each subclass to implement those behaviors in its own unique way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract superclasses cannot be instantiated, meaning they cannot be used to create objects directly. Instead, they serve as blueprints for creating objects of their concrete subclasses. The main advantage of using an abstract superclass is that it allows for a high degree of code reuse and modularity in object-oriented programming."
